I am not a programmer, but I'd better learn something to be useful.

Edmonton, Alberta Canada is where I call home now.
Adopt senior cats that rescues have trouble placing. They aren't with me for a long time, but a good time.
Ferret lover, but presently not owned by any.
Human Rights apply to everyone. Even the stupid.
COVID-19 will not ruin my fun, wear a mask, wash your hands and don't engage in risky behaviour. 
Camping is awesome if our government doesn't F-it up.
Handy with tools, doesn't mean awesome at code. Not everyone's brain does code.
